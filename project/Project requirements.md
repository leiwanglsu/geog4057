# GIS Programming Class Project Requirements

## Project Overview

This project requires students to apply GIS programming skills to address a geospatial problem. Students will create a solution that demonstrates their ability to use spatial data, analysis techniques, and programming skills to solve a real-world GIS-related challenge. The project will culminate in a code repository and documentation. Use your class github repository for project development.

The instructor provides two guided class projects [guided project 1](./guided%20project%201.md) [guided project 2](./guided%20project%202.md). If you want to use a guided project as your term project, you can complete your project during the class.

## Group development

- If you want to do group work, a maximum of three persons can work on the same project as a group. The roles of each person in the project must be identified.
- The repository of the project must be shared among the group. Commit history should show the contribution from all members.


## Project Objectives

- **Identify a GIS Problem**: Define a problem that can be effectively solved or explored using GIS and programming techniques.
- **Data Collection and Preparation**: Identify, collect, and preprocess spatial datasets relevant to the problem.
- **Develop a Programmatic Solution**: Use GIS programming tools (e.g., Python with ArcPy, GeoPandas, QGIS PyQGIS, etc.) to create an automated solution or application.
- **User interface**: The tools shall be developed with a user interface such as script tools or python toolboxes in ArcGIS or a plugin in QGIS. 
- **Analyze Results and Visualize Output**: Analyze the data and create visual outputs, such as maps or interactive web layers.
- **Present Findings and Code**: Provide a documentation report to show the project development, usage, and maps.

## Project Workflow & Deliverables

### 1. Project summary

- **Requirements**:
  - **Problem Statement**: Define the objective of the project
  - **Data Sources**: Describe datasets required, including their format, source, and any preprocessing steps.
  - **Methods and Tools**: Outline the GIS programming tools (e.g., ArcPy, ArcGIS API, GeoPandas, gdal, VS Code, etc.) and any additional libraries.
  - **Challenges and Timeline**: Identify potential challenges and outline a project timeline.


### 2. Development of GIS Solution

- **Requirements**:

  - Write a Python script based on ArcPy, ArcGIS API for Python, Google Earth Engine, or ArcGIS model builder to solve the GIS problem.
  - Include functionalities such as data management (importing, cleaning, clipping, reprojection), spatial analysis (buffering, overlays, spatial joins) or data visualization (plotting, thematic mapping).
  - Include a user interface that allows users to use the tool in either ArcGIS or QGIS
  - Version-controlled code in a GitHub repository or equivalent.

### 3. Project Documentation

- **Requirements**:
  - A comprehensive report including:
    - **Introduction**: Background on the GIS problem and objectives.
    - **Methodology**: Explanation of data sources, processing steps, and analysis approach.
    - **Code Documentation**: A high-level code outline with explanations of key functions.
    - **Results and Visualization**: Explanation of results with visual outputs.
    - **Challenges and Future Work**: Discussion of limitations and potential improvements.
    - **References**: Properly formatted citations for all data sources and resources.

## Grading Criteria

Projects will be evaluated based on:

- **Problem Definition and Relevance**: Clarity and appropriateness of the GIS problem and objectives.
- **Data Handling and Processing**: Ability to handle and preprocess spatial data effectively.
- **Programming Quality**: Quality of the code (modularity, readability, error handling).
- **GIS Analysis and Solution**: Accuracy and depth of geospatial analysis and overall functionality.
- **Visualization and Presentation**: Quality and relevance of visual outputs, clarity of presentation.
- **Documentation**: Completeness and clarity of the report, including thorough documentation of methods and code.

## Additional Notes

- **Project Management**: Use of version control (e.g., Git), adherence to deadlines, and organization are essential.
- **Instructor Guidance**: Regular check-ins for feedback on code and methodology are encouraged.
- **Academic Integrity**: Code created by generative AI should be acknowledged in your report.
