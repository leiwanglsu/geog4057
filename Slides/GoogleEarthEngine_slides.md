## What is Google Earth Engine (GEE)
:::
::: block


- Earth Engine is a platform for scientific analysis and visualization of geospatial datasets, for academic, non-profit, business and government users.
- Earth Engine hosts satellite imagery and stores it in a public data archive that includes historical earth images going back more than forty years. The images, ingested on a daily basis, are then made available for global-scale data mining.
- Earth Engine also provides APIs and other tools to enable online analysis of large datasets: JavaScript, Python, REST.
- Trending keywords in GISciences: Big Data, Cloud computing, Python

## classes and functions in GEE

---
<!-- slide template="[[tpl-con-default-box]]" -->
::: title
### class `ImageCollection`
:::
::: block

- `ImageCollection` is a fundamental data structure in Google Earth Engine.
- It represents a collection of images, where each image typically corresponds to a specific date or time and is associated with spatial information.
- Images within a collection are usually related by a common theme, such as being captured by the same sensor or covering the same geographical area.
- Images in the collection are organized along a temporal dimension, representing the time of acquisition.
- Users can filter and manipulate the collection based on temporal criteria, such as date ranges or specific time points.

:::

---

<!-- slide template="[[tpl-con-default-box]]" -->
::: title
#### Filtering images:
:::
::: block


- Users can filter the ImageCollection based on various criteria, including time, location, and metadata attributes.
- This allows for the extraction of subsets of images that meet specific conditions.
- Spatial filtering: use locations and geometries to filter images
  - function: `filterBounds() `
- Temporal filtering: use time to filter images
  - function: `filterDate()`
- Use a ee.Filter: 
  `image.filter(ee.Filter.eq('CLOUD_COVER', 0))`


:::

---
<!-- slide template="[[tpl-con-default-box]]" -->
::: title
#### Sorting image:
:::
::: block

- Images in the collection can be sorted 
- For example, the images are sorted by cloud cover: 
```javascript
var sorted = temporalFiltered.sort('CLOUD_COVER');
```

- After sorting, users can access individual images by using first() or last(): 
 
```javascript
var scene = sorted.first();
```

:::

---

<!-- slide template="[[tpl-con-default-box]]" -->
::: title
#### first, median, mean, max, min, sum, product
:::
::: block
- These functions will reduce the collection to an image
- Use them accordingly
- For example, `imagecoll.first()` will return the first image in the collection
:::
---
<!-- slide template="[[tpl-con-default-box]]" -->
::: title
#### Examples of ImageCollections:
:::
::: block
- Landsat and Sentinel satellite collections: Contain images captured by the Landsat and Sentinel satellite systems, respectively.
- MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) collections: Provide daily global observations at moderate spatial resolutions.
- This code will return an imageCollection object of Landsat 7, collection 1, and tier 1 collection of images

```javascript
var collection = ee.ImageCollection('LANDSAT/LE07/C01/T1')
```

:::

---
<!-- slide template="[[tpl-con-default-box]]" -->
::: title
### class `Image`
:::
::: block
- An Image is a georeferenced raster dataset that contains pixel values representing some Earth observation or measurement.
- Each pixel in the image is associated with a specific geographic location, determined by its coordinates (latitude, longitude) and a coordinate reference system.
- An image can consist of one or more bands, where each band represents a different spectral or thematic information.
  - For example, a multispectral satellite image might have bands corresponding to different wavelengths of light (e.g., red, green, blue, infrared).
:::

---

<!-- slide template="[[tpl-con-default-box]]" -->
::: title
#### Operations and Analysis:
:::
::: block
- Users can perform various operations and analyses on images, including mathematical transformations, filtering, compositing, and statistical computations.
- The operations can be applied to individual bands or the entire image.
:::

---
<!-- slide template="[[tpl-con-default-box]]" -->
::: title
#### Visualization:
:::
::: block
- Images can be visualized using the Google Earth Engine Code Editor or other visualization tools. 
- A map class is used to work with the visualization
- Visualization often involves assigning colors to different bands and displaying the result as a map.
::: 

---

<!-- slide template="[[tpl-con-default-box]]" -->
::: title
#### Export:
:::
::: block
- Processed images or derived information can be exported from Google Earth Engine for further analysis or external use.

::: 

---

<!-- slide template="[[tpl-con-default-box]]" -->
::: title
#### Get an image by its ID
:::
::: block
```ee.Image('LANDSAT/LT05/C01/T1_TOA/LT05_031034_20110619')```

- The ID has several components: Satellite, sensor, collection, tier, path and row, date
- `LANDSAT` Indicates that the image is from the Landsat satellite series. Landsat satellites capture multispectral imagery of the Earth's surface.
	- LT05: Specifies the Landsat 5 satellite sensor. Each Landsat satellite has a different sensor, and Landsat 5 was equipped with the Thematic Mapper (TM) sensor.
- `C01` Represents the Collection 1 level of data. Landsat Collection 1 data is a consistently processed set of data products.
- `T1_TOA` Stands for Tier 1 Top of Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance. TOA reflectance values are corrected for atmospheric effects, providing a measure of the Earth's surface reflectance.
- `LT05_031034` Specifies the path and row numbers of the Landsat scene. In this case, it corresponds to Landsat Path 31 and Row 34. The combination of path and row uniquely identifies a specific location on the Earth's surface.
- `20110619` Represents the acquisition date of the image in the format YYYYMMDD. In this example, the image was acquired on June 19, 2011.
::: 

---
<!-- slide template="[[tpl-con-default-box]]" -->
::: title
#### `Image.select()`
:::
::: block
- Returns an image with the selected bands.

```javascript
print(image1.select('SR_B2').bandNames().getInfo())
print(image1.select(['SR_B7', 'SR_B5', 'SR_B3'], ['SWIR1', 'NIR', 'Green']).bandNames().getInfo())
```
- SR_B2 is the band name defined by the ImageCollection for the second band of the image. SR means "Surface Reflectance"
- getInfo() retrieves information from the server about the object
::: 
---

<!-- slide template="[[tpl-con-default-box]]" -->
::: title
#### `Image.expression()`
:::
::: block
- Imnage.expression is a method to create a new image by specifying the mathematical expression to be applied to the pixel values  
- Syntax ``` var newImage = oldImage.expression(expression, {variableDictionary}```
- Example:

```javascript
// Example: Creating a new image by applying a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) expression
var landsatImage = ee.Image('LANDSAT/LC08/C01/T1_TOA/LC08_044034_20140318');
var ndviExpression = '(B5 - B4) / (B5 + B4)';
var ndviImage = landsatImage.expression(ndviExpression, {
  'B4': landsatImage.select('B4'), // Red band
  'B5': landsatImage.select('B5')  // Near-Infrared band
});
Map.addLayer(ndviImage)
```

- the b() function in an expression can be used to get a band from the image

```javascript
var ndviExpression = "(b('B5') - b('B4')) / (b('B5') + b('B4'))";
var ndviImage = LandsatImage.expression(ndviExpression);
```
::: 

---

<!-- slide template="[[tpl-con-default-box]]" -->
::: title
#### `Image.NormalizedDifference()`
:::
::: block
- A common function for multi-band images to perform normalized difference equation: (b1 - b2) / (b1 + b2)
- The bands should be define. If not, the first two bands will be used
`var ndviImage = LandsatImage.NormalizedDifference();`
::: 

---

<!-- slide template="[[tpl-con-default-box]]" -->
::: title
### `ee.Date`
:::
::: block
- The ee.Date class is used to represent and manipulate dates and times.
- Constructing a ee.Date using an string: ```var specificDate = ee.Date('2022-01-01');```
- Or create a date with Date.now(): ```var currentDate = ee.Date(Date.now());```
- ee.Date allows to perform arithmetic operations on dates: ```var newDate = currentDate.advance(1, 'day');```
- Parsing and formatting the date to strings

```javascript
var dateString = '2022-01-01';
var parsedDate = ee.Date.parse('YYYY-MM-dd', dateString);
var formattedDate = parsedDate.format('YYYY-MM-dd');
```

::: 

---

<!-- slide template="[[tpl-con-default-box]]" -->
::: title
### `ee.Geometry`
:::
::: block
- ee.Geometry allows users to work with geometries
- Geometries include point, polygon, Rectangle, LineString, BBox
```var point = ee.Geometry.Point([-122.0838, 37.4220]);```
- Geometries can be created from GeoJSON objects

```javascript
var geojsonObject = { "type": "Polygon", "coordinates": [ [ [-122.085,37.423],[ -122.092, 37.424],[ -122.085, 37.418], [-122.085,37.423]] ]}
var p1 = ee.Geometry(geojsonObject)
print(p1.area().getInfo())
```

- Visualization of geometries

```javascript
var point = ee.Geometry.Point([-122.0838, 37.4220]);
Map.centerObject(point, 10); // Center the map on the point
Map.addLayer(point, {color: 'red'}, 'Point');
```

::: 

---

<!-- slide template="[[tpl-con-default-box]]" -->
::: title
### Export
:::
::: block
- The class is to export images or tables to user specified locations
- ee.Export.image.toDrive: Used to export an image or image collection to Google Drive.
- ee.Export.table.toDrive: Used to export a table to Google Drive.
- ee.Export.table.toAsset: Used to export a table to an Earth Engine asset.

```javascript
Export.image.toDrive({
  image: landsat,
  description: 'imageToDriveExample_transform',
  crs: projection.crs,
  crsTransform: projection.transform,
  region: geometry
});
```

::: 

---

<!-- slide template="[[tpl-con-default-box]]" -->
::: title
## Server and client computation
:::
::: block
- Because GEE codes run on personal computers (client) and use cloud (server) resources, some functions from clients don't mix with server functions
- Client functions such as print(), getInfo() or any method on Map, Chart, or Export may have different behaviors with server objects such as imagecollection, image, and date
- Mostly, you shall use getInfo() to extract certain properties from the ee objects
::: 


---

<!-- slide template="[[tpl-con-default-box]]" -->
::: title
### `getInfo()`
:::
::: block
- Return a collection description whose fields include 
  - features: a list containing metadata about the images in the collection.
  - bands: a dictionary describing the bands of the images in this collection.
  - properties: an optional dictionary containing the collection's metadata properties.
::: 


---

<!-- slide template="[[tpl-con-default-box]]" -->
::: title
## Visualization
:::
::: block
### `addLayer`

- Map.addLayer function needs the visualization parameters visParams
- To define visParams for a multiband image, you need bands, min, and max
- ```vis = {'bands': ['B4', 'B3', 'B2'],'min': [0, 0, 0], 'max': [10000,10000, 10000]}```
- For single band visParams, you need min, max, and color progression

```javascript
singleBandVis = { min: 0, max: 3000, palette: ['blue', 'yellow', 'green']}
```
::: 

---

<!-- slide template="[[tpl-con-default-box]]" -->
::: title

#### Try this example:
:::
::: block
```javascript
var landsatImage = ee.Image('LANDSAT/LC08/C01/T1_TOA/LC08_044034_20140318');
var ndviExpression = '(B5 - B4) / (B5 + B4)';
var ndviImage = landsatImage.expression(ndviExpression, {
  'B4': landsatImage.select('B4'), // Red band
  'B5': landsatImage.select('B5')  // Near-Infrared band
});
var vis = {min: -1, max: 1, palette:['blue','yellow','green']};
Map.addLayer(ndviImage,vis);
```
- min, max, and palette are elements of a dictionary data structure required by the visualization parameter of `.addLayer()` function

:::

#### Use Python for Gee
:::
::: block
- You can select to use Python instead of JavaScript and run code on different platforms
- Install the Python API: `pip install earthengine-api`
- After installation, use `import ee` to import the modules
- At the first time of running the module, you need to authenticate your Google account to use gee on your computer
- Use `ee.Authenticate()` to authenticate or run 
- Before running authentication, make sure your account has been registered as Google developer by going to this site: `https://code.earthengine.google.com/`

:::


---

<!-- slide template="[[tpl-con-default-box]]" -->
::: title

#### Use the map module `geemap`
:::
::: block
- Unlike the code interface of Gee in JavaScript, the Gee Python module does not provide a module to show map in Jupyter notebooks
- You can install a third-party package `geemap` to display Google data on a map
```run-python
import geemap

# Create a map centered at a specific location
Map = geemap.Map(center=[40, -100], zoom=4) 

# Add a basemap from Google Maps
Map.add_basemap('HYBRID')

# Display the map
Map
```
